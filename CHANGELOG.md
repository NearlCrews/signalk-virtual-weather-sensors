## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-20

### 🚀 Added

#### Test Coverage
- **WeatherService.test.ts**: 25 comprehensive tests covering initialization, lifecycle management, data emission, and configuration validation
- **SignalKService.test.ts**: 40 tests for vessel navigation data retrieval including position, speed, course, heading, caching, and health status
- Total test count increased from 85 to 150 tests

#### Observability & Metrics
- **New metrics utility** (`src/utils/metrics.ts`): Full-featured metrics collector supporting counters, gauges, and histograms
- Pre-configured plugin metrics for API requests, errors, updates, emissions, cache size, and timing histograms
- `MetricsCollector` class with `timeAsync()` for timing function execution
- `getSnapshot()` method for metrics reporting

#### Security & Reliability
- **API key log sanitization**: Automatic filtering of sensitive keys (apikey, password, secret, token) from log output
- **Retry-After header support**: Respects server rate limit headers for 429 and 503 responses
- **Exponential backoff**: Falls back to exponential backoff when Retry-After header not present
- **Polling jitter**: ±10% random variation on update intervals to prevent synchronized API requests

### 🔄 Changed

#### Improved Logger Implementation
- Warning messages now call `app.setPluginStatus()` for Signal K UI visibility
- Error messages now call `app.setPluginError()` for Signal K UI visibility
- All log metadata automatically sanitized to remove sensitive information

#### Enhanced API Key Validation
- Minimum length validation (20 characters)
- Maximum length warning (>40 characters)
- Alphanumeric format validation via regex pattern
- Detection of common placeholder patterns (your-api-key, test, demo, etc.)

#### Memory Management
- **Location cache pruning**: Automatic removal of expired entries (>2 hours old)
- **Cache size limits**: Maximum 100 entries with LRU-style eviction
- Cache pruning runs every 5 minutes to prevent memory growth

### 📝 Documentation

#### Documented Performance Thresholds
- `WEATHER_UPDATE` (5000ms): Based on AccuWeather API typical response times (1-3 seconds)
